This repository supports the book: 
### Advanced Programming for Numerical Calculations: Climbing Python and Fortran [Amazon book ](https://www.amazon.es/Advanced-Programming-Numerical-Calculations-Climbing/dp/B0BF2M1QT9)[PDF](https://github.com/jahrWork/NumericalHUB/tree/master/doc/NumericalHUB_Jan_2022.pdf)
 
This book is devoted to those who like math and use
programming languages such as: Python or Fortran to solve numerical problems.
The main focus of this book is to approach math language to programming languages by
paying attention to functional programming paradigm.
Through different numerical examples,
the book tries to mimic mathematics by showing how mathematical concepts
are implemented by means of functional programming paradigm.

This book is divided in three parts:
1) Foundations.
2) Computer operations with integers and reals.
3) Advanced programming.
   
These three parts can be read independently. The first part: Foundations is devoted to
initiate the reader in implementing numerical problems with the computer.
The second part: Computer operations with integers and reals.
Real or integer numbers are represented with finite storage. When oerating those numbers,
errors associated to the loss of precision is encountered. This second part tries to get a deep
knowledge, by following different examples, of this round-off errors.
The third part: Advanced programming gives tries to show the most important techniques
focalizing mainly in the functional programming paradigm with pure functions
emulating math environments.

This book can not be considered a full handbook of Python or Fortran.
It is a modest approach of challenging numerical problems by means of
functional programming in Python and Fortran.
This book is fully supported with the present software repository.
