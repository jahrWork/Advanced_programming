 \section{Roots of a second degree equation} 
 In this section, a program to obtain the roots of a second order equation is presented:  
 $$
    a x^2 + b x + c = 0, \qquad \forall \ a, b, c \in \Re.
 $$
 The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every  Nth order polynomial has N complex roots. 
 If the coefficients are real, then the roots are complex conjugate.
 Dividing the above equation by $ a $ an looking for a perfect square, 
 the following equation allows is obtained: 
 $$
    \left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 - \frac{b^2 }{ 4 a^2} + \frac{c}{a} = 0. 
 $$
 Solving the unknown $ x$, the well known formula for the roots is obtained: 
 \begin{equation}
     x_{1,2} = \frac{ - b \pm \sqrt{ b^2 - 4 a c }  }{ 2 a  }  
     \label{x12}
 \end{equation} 
 If the discriminant $ d = b^2 - 4 a c $ is les than zero, roots become complex. 
 In the following code, complex solutions given by (\ref{x12}) are implemented. 
 Note that the discriminant $ d $ was defined as a complex variable to avoid math problems 
 when the discriminant is negative. Whereas the root a real negative number is not defined,
 the root of a negative number  
 number has a value when considering working with complex numbers.
