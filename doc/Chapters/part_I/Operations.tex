\section{Roots of a second degree equation} 
In this section, a program to obtain the roots of a second order equation is presented:  
$$
a x^2 + b x + c = 0, \qquad \forall \ a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}.
$$
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every  Nth order polynomial has N complex roots. 
If the coefficients are real, then the roots are complex conjugate.
Dividing the above equation by $ a $ an looking for a perfect square, 
the following equation is obtained: 
$$
\left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 - \frac{b^2 }{ 4 a^2} + \frac{c}{a} = 0. 
$$
Solving the unknown $x$, the well known formula for the roots is obtained: 
\begin{equation}
 x_{1,2} = \frac{ - b \pm \sqrt{ b^2 - 4 a c }  }{ 2 a  }  
 \label{x12}
\end{equation} 
If the discriminant $ d = b^2 - 4 a c $ is less than zero, roots become complex. 
In the following code, complex solutions given by (\ref{x12}) are implemented. 
Note that the discriminant $ d $ was defined as a complex variable to avoid math problems 
when the discriminant is negative. Whereas the root of a real negative number is not defined,
the root of a negative number has a value for complex numbers.

\subsection*{Python code}
The same function is presented below coded with Python. Essentially both codes are quite similar, 
however, now data types for variables are not explicitly declared because 
Python automatically declares them. In addition, indentation rules must be strictly followed.
