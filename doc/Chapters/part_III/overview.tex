One of the main characteristics to reuse code is generic programming.  
Generic programming is based on abstract variable types that are then instantiated when they are used for specific variable type.

Since Python is non typed language, 
generic programming in this language is straightforward. 
However, in Fortran the use of abstract  \lstinline{class(*)} 
allows to use different data types at run time.
