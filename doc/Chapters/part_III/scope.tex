 \chapter{Scope} 
 
 
 
\section{Introduction}

In this section we take a deeper look at how the scope is treated in Fortran and Python since each programming language has its own particularities. 
Fortran has two units of program (\texttt{program} and \texttt{module}) and two units of subprogram (\texttt{subroutine} and \texttt{function}).
Everything declared at the beginning of a program/subprogram will be treated as global for that unit. Hence, all units of program nested will see the entity. 
This also includes the \texttt{use} statement, e.g. a main program using a module makes visible all the global entities of the module in the main program. 






%In the following code,  variables $x, y,z $ are visible inside the subroutine \texttt{Test}.  
In the following code, the variable $y$ is a global variable of module \texttt{modB} and $x$ is a global variable of module \texttt{modA}.  
Then, $y$ is seen inside function \texttt{functionB()} and $x$ is seen in \texttt{functionA}.
All global variables of \texttt{modB} are seen outside by means of the sentence \texttt{use modB}. 
Besides, since \texttt{modB} uses \texttt{modA}, all global variables of \texttt{modA} are seen in \texttt{modB}. 
More specifically, this means that $x$ is also seen in \texttt{functionB()}.

%The region of a program in which this variable or identifier is visible is called the scope.
%set of statements in which the variable can be used or modified
% This is called the scope of the visibility of some variable in some part of our code. 
%Local variables are those which specified inside the function or subroutine that we are dealing with and global variables are those that can be accessed by common variables of my own module  or by inclusions of other modules.
